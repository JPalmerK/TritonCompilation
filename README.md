# TritonCompilation 
This repo contains modified version of Triton (https://github.com/MarineBioAcousticsRC/Triton) with multiple remoras pre-installed


# Remora Status
## Explosion-Detector
Installed appears to be working (no errors, produces data) on wav files. Not tested on HARP data. 

## Fish Detector
Installed may be working? Runs, no errors but doesn't produce data (potentially no fish in the local example data)
